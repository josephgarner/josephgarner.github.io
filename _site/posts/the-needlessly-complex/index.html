        <div class="content"><p>At the start of 2022 I set out on a goal to build an automated irrigation system for my sad and vacant courtyard garden. Rather than walking down the sane path of purchasing an off- the- shelf system, I chose to build a completely custom set-up from scratch.</p>

<p>There are a few reasons why I chose this avenue; firstly, my frontend development skills have become rusty over the past few months of nothing but backend development work, and. secondly, I like a challenge. This project would involve working with small electronics, 3D modelling and printing, carpentry and programming. Out of those listed 4 core aspects, the only thing I held experience in was programming. So I had a lot to learn. The final reason I chose this project was privacy. So many of our devices have tracking systems in them in one way or another, and although I probably shouldn’t care if a third party can track when I water my plants, I do.</p>

<h4 id="the-plan">The Plan</h4>
<p>At the start I was a little ambitious, below is a list of all the key factors.</p>

<p>With this list I was able to draft up a little diagram of how the backend system would work.</p>

<p>Although my focus was set on getting the backend system up and running, which would allow me to worry about the frontend later, I still drafted a simplistic high- level view of the entire system.</p>

<h4 id="the-components">The Components</h4>
<p>For the brains of the operation I chose to use my old Raspberry Pi Zero Wireless. This little computer would control the flow of information and save all data to a non- relational database (MongoDB). The planter nodes would be controlled via an ESP8266 node with a capacitive moisture sensor – this node would use Wi-Fi to communicate with the server. The user interface would be built using the ReactJS framework which would be hosted on the Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>The plans had been drawn up, and the technology selected. I felt unstoppable, I had a plan fueled by confidence and blind arrogance, blissfully unaware of the sole crushing hurdles that lay ahead.</p>
